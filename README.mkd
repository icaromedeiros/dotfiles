Introduction
------------

My dot files, including configurations for vim, git, zsh, iTerm, and OS X.

Installing
----------

Just clone the repo and use make commands to install configurations.

As git is installed with `make brew`,
an alternative is to download `https://github.com/icaromedeiros/dotfiles/archive/master.zip`.

For example, to install vim packages and configurations:

```
make vim
```

To install everything, in the right order, use:

```
make all
```
