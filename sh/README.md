# Shell options

Well, I use Zsh on MacOS at other OS'es /shells in production.

At least, let's try to reuse aliases and envvars.

RUN FROM HERE!

- After installing zsh with brew
- Install oh-my-zsh with `sh zsh/install.sh` and you will see the default ZSH prompt
- Run `install_commons.sh` to install aliases, variables, `.zshrc` in `$HOME` and ZSH plugins oustide oh-my-zsh scope
